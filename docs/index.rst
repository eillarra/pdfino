=====================
Welcome to ``pdfino``
=====================

PDFINO is a Python library for generating PDF files. It is built on top of `ReportLab`_,
a powerful PDF generation library for Python. PDFINO is designed to be simple and easy to use.
It provides a high-level API for generating PDF files without having to deal with the low-level details of ReportLab.

PDFINO keeps things streamlined, but **it won't replace all of ReportLab's powers**. You can always add ReportLab
flowables directly to your document if you need to.
